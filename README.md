# ATMS 523 Module-3

This project investigates different machine learning models of varying complexity using Python's [Scikit-Learn Library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html) to predict the target variable of rain rate from different polarimetric radar parameters calculated from data collected for several years by a disdrometer in Huntsville, Alabama. This project looks at the R sqaured values and the root mean squared errors between the baseline, a multiple linear regression model, a polynomial regression model, and a random forest regression model.

## Setting Up
For this project, you will need some basic python packages like numpy and matplotlib, but this project also requires pandas and scikit-learn. To install these pacakges using conda, execute the following commands in your environment:
    
    conda install pandas
    conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn

## How to Use
Run the python jupyter notebook project5_atms523_blind.ipynb. There are 4 different parts to this project and markdown cells/comments detail each part of the project in the jupyter notebook.

## Maintenance of Project
This project was created for the University of Illinois ATMS 523 Weather and Climate Data Analytics course. The project is completed at this time.
